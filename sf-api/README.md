# Use the superfacility API to interact with NERSC

## Token authentication
- To get a token, please check the readme file in the main page. 
- When using the API, you need to authenticate yourself. The API uses token authentication. The IP address of the client is used to determine the user. For testing I am using `JIRIAF2302` whose IP address is `129.57.178.20`.
- The token is not uploaded to github. Manually copy the files to the `sf-api/key/red` folder.`
